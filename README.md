# Angry Bird
![Screenshot](https://github.com/IvanT98/angry_birds/blob/master/angry-bird.png)

A simple game made by following the "How to Make a Game - Unity Beginner Tutorial" by Jason Weimann.

As evident from the tile, this game is a simple clone of the popular mobile game "Angry Birds".

The point of the game is for the player to slingshot the bird at "pigs" and try to hit them all in one go. The game only has two levels.

The camera effect was made by using the Cinemachine Unity Package.
