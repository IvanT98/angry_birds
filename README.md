# Angry Bird

A simple game made by following the "How to Make a Game - Unity Beginner Tutorial" by Jason Weimann.

As evident from the tile, this game is a simple clone of the popular mobile game "Angry Birds".

The point of the game is for the player to slingshot the bird at "pigs" and try to hit them all in one go. The game only has two levels.

The player controls the slingshot by holding the left mouse button near the bird and dragging it in the opposite directrion of the "pigs". Afterwards, the player needs to release the left mouse button to apply force to the bird. The further the distance of the drag, the more force will be applied to the bird.

The camera effect was made by using the Cinemachine Unity Package.
